Due to the latest server side upgrade and (unexpected) need to change configuration, the previous YAWn! client versions are no longer working. A new version is available in the downloads section. 
More status updates will occur in this post as soon as available. 

Update 1: AutoYAWn! and Online YAWn! should now be working properly (only RCON services). Try it out! 
Update 2: latest YAWn! client version 1.3 available in the downloads section. Problems can be posted on our forum.
