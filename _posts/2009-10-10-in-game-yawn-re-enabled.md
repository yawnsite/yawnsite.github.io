This afternoon I've re-enabled the YAWn! client for the big public. 
Sil has been using it successfully already for a short while now; I guess it's time to enable it for everyone (again)! (Thanks Sil!) 

So start the game of your choice (Quake 3, Return to Castle Wolfenstein or Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory), and start YAWning! 

Get the proper version from the downloads section. 

For the game server admins among you, feel free to use the Online YAWn! feature which has been re-enabled for quite a while already. 

Last but not least, I've been thinking about setting up something to receive donations lately. Feel free to tell us on the forum how you feel about it.
