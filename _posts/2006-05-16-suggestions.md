Let's start with apologizing to the core Quake4 users. Ever since Q4 1.2 Point Release, we are unable to communicate properly with the game (as we did before). This means, either waiting for a next patch, or ... 

What I wonder is, what might be interesting for the YAWn! users to have. A generic YAWn! application for all punkbuster games? What games are the most interesting for YAWn? A (game)serverside YAWn application? Any other suggestions? 

Proper feedback and suggestions are more than welcome on the forum.
