Woohoo! Eclipse worked hard this summer on the YAWn linux version. He might even be ready to do some beta testing soon. 

If you want to sign up for testing, mail betatest at yawn dot be. Or just contact us in #-=[bzz]=- at quakenet or even forum. Don't forget to mention what linux distribution you are using.
