Today, after many years of service, YAWn! officially enters retirement. We've been in maintenance mode for a very long time, basically just keeping the lights on.
We've learned a lot. We've met a lot of interesting people. A lot of money has been spent. A lot of code was written. A lot of code has been re-written. Many CPU cycles were wasted :-). A lot of hosting providers came and went... But it was always fun and exciting to be part of the supporting game communities.

Thanks all, especially thanks to the old core BOOZZEGAMING community.
