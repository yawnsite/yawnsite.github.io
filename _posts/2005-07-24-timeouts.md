Some people always get the following error in Enemy Territory, even though in console the /guids are displayed.

> YAWn! Unknown Error: Timeout during /guids command. Could not retrieve guids. 

Check if cg_drawNotifyText is set to 1. If it's not, set it to 1 using: 

```
/cg_drawNotifyText 1 
```

Try to `/yawn` again, it should be solved. 
Change your config files according (if possible). 

Thanks fretn :)
