Early this evening some major changes are done behind the curtains to get ready for Quake4. Although this should not impact normal use of the website and earlier versions of the YAWn! client, please let me know any problems that might be occuring. 

So, next few days (weeks?) is all about testing the brand new 1.1 client. We'll let you know when it will be released for the big public.

Be sure to let them Q4 players already know what YAWn! is, and what it does!
