For performance reasons the warning-icon is now removed from the playersearch results. From now on the warnings are available on the playerdetails screen, meaning one click extra.

Since Quake 4 is now officially released, we might say that it's 90% sure it WILL be integrated in the client software. Still considering some issues :). 
Bad news for Doom 3 players (if there are any :p), it will NOT be implemented in the client software.
