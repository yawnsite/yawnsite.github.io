Here it is. Our very first YAWn stats edition. 

What's new? Apart from some minor bugfixes that were still in the 0.8x version, the biggest new feature is the stats listener. If you want to know more about it read this. 

Downloads are available here. For problems and information you can always contacts us in #-=[bzz]=- @ quakenet or our forum. Please read the readme and faq first BEFORE installing and running YAWn. Especially this should solve most questions & problems. 

Have fun and... hope to see you here soon :p
