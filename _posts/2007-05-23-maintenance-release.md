It was finally time for a maintenance release: our YAWn website and services are updated with small tweaks and changes. 

Please note that none of the previous client software will be working due to necessary changes. Find your new YAWn! client in our download section! 

Most important change (1.4.2700 or better): 
For Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, YAWn! client is now supported on non etpro modded servers! 

In case of issues, you know where to report, but please read known issues first.
