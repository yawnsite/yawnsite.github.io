title:  "New game, more punkbuster guids"

We've just added Enemy Territory: Quake Wars to our list of games. However, it's not (yet) compatible with our YAWn! Client, neither with Online YAWn!. For now only punkbuster guids coming from the known public banlist sites are added. Yes, there are warnings already :). 

Our current (short) todo list: 
- Add support for ETQW using the Online YAWn! feature. 
- Display ip's for serverside gathered guids 

More ideas and suggestions are always welcome on the forum.
