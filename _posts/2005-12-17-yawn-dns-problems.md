As you might have noticed we're having some problems with the yawn.be domain. Where a week ago I believed it to be a powercut problem, I have no real clue what exactly is the issue now. 
As I don't receive any feedback from the agent, I can only hope that it will be solved soon. 

For the time being, yawn.boozze.be can still be used. The latest YAWn! client(s) however will not be functioning. I'll try to put an alternative version online this evening, for the hardcore YAWn! users. 

Thanks for your understanding :)
