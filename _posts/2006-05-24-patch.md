YAWn! client seems to be responding incorrectly to the output of the latest punkbuster server update. A patch is in progress, and will normally be released tomorrow. 

Impacted games and punkbuster versions: 
* Enemy Territory	(v1.229) 
* Quake III Arena	(v1.229) 
* Call of Duty (v1.230) 
* Return to Castle Wolfenstein (v1.229) 

See you tomorrow! 
Thanks `eistee`, `teente` and `unblind`.

Edit: 
On a side note, the latest patch from id Software causes punkbuster (client) command `pb_myguid` to behave incorrectly, which makes YAWn actions impossible. 

Impacted patches: 
* Quake III Arena 1.32c Patch 
* Return to Castle Wolfenstein 1.41b Patch 
* Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory 2.60b Patch 

This issue has been reported to evenbalance and will be fixed the next punkbuster client update. 
Thanks `SteamN`.
