As of today, we try to keep the YAWn database updated with the monthly public MBL found on punksbusted.com. 
For now we only feature COD, Q3, RTCW and SOF2. Enemy Territory MBL warnings aren't integrated (yet). 

Warnings are only visible on the site after a playersearch (if any availble). If possible we'll integrate it into the YAWn client and we can even expand it to include your own customized warning(s) for a user, guid, etc... . 

Be aware that the initial import is running tonight, response times can be slow during this time.
