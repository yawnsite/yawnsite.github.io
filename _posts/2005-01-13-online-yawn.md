Last 2 weeks we've been busy with the online yawn (rcon) feature. 

Features (short version): 
- Some 'big' public servers are automatically yawned 
- Servers can be available for everyone to yawn online. Example 

If you have a big server for us to yawn automatically, don't hesitate to contact us. Supported games (for now) are Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Enemy Territory and Call of duty. Servers for other punkbuster supported games are welcome for debugging purposes :). 

More detailed information later! 

Btw, thanks telenet.et and telenet.cod community leaders for their support!
