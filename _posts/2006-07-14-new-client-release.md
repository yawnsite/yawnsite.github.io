Major changes done to the YAWn! client. Next to some maintenance, the most important feature is the MBL/MBI warnings that are now (finally) displayed in the client. Try it! 
Please download and install the most recent version. Older versions will no longer work correctly! 

Website changes: 
- several performance tweaks 
- requested (minor) changes 
- both application server and webserver tweaks 

Feedback is always appreciated in the forum.
