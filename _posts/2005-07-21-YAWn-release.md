After lots of development and testing time, finally YAWn!.NET Version 1.0.5 is available in the downloads section. 
I don't think we need a big release party :p, just download and spread the word! 

Before you all start using it, take some time to read the introduction and the faq. Don't forget to take a look at the readme included in the download as well. 

If you still don't know what YAWn! is for, or how it works, refer to What Is YAWn!?. 

Be aware that this is not just for Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, but also for Call of Duty, Quake 3 and Return to Castle Wolfenstein!
