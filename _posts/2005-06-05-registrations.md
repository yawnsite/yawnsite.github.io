Since yesterday, 6th June, somewhere in the afternoon, we got our mail server configuration up and running. Thanks fretn and cobralord! This means that you can now register successfully! 

The users that tried to register before, should re-register. Sorry for the inconvenience :). 
Users from the old yawn application are not allowed, they as well should re-register. 

Keep in mind that the useraccount you create will be used in the near future for the YAWn client as well. 

Now that registrations work, we can finally start using the Online YAWn! feature. Read all about it, and then try it out! 
Let me know if any bugs come up.
