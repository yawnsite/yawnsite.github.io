Remember one year ago? Well, apparently it was time for a new look! BroQ did a great job (again)! Thanks!

What else is new? 
You might have noticed a nice performance tweak while doing your player searches. Some of the credits go - once again - to, soon to be daddy, Dis4ea! 

What's coming? 
Apart for some more tweaks and stuff, let's introduce a Quake4 compatible YAWn! Yeah baby yeah, spread the word, YAWn! is coming to Quake4!
