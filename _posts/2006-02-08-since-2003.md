I just realized that yet another YAWn birthday arrived. Ever since February 2003 (probably even earlier), although Benelux and RtCW only in the old days, we YAWned and kept YAWning! 

So congratulations to the active YAWn users! Hopefully 2006 will bring more guids and other (active) games to YAWn. 

-- A little retro moment: 
People like `[DZM]GoldDragon`, `-)NW(-Legionair` and `Longjacket` were first added in the old database, playing on servers like `Konijn` or `Telenet`. 
And let's not forget the old RtCW clanservers powered by `BGAMES.BE` and `GameServers.net`.
