The missing rtcw guids, gathered during the previous 2 years, should now be displayed correctly in the YAWn client and on the YAWn website. 
Ever since the new database structure I never came around to fix these missing guids. Actually, they weren't missing, they just were incorrectly imported in the new structure. Anyway, should be solved now, let me know if you still think something is missing.
