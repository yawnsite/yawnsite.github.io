We've re-enabled and resynced the MBL PsB banlists for all supported games: 
- W:ET 
- RTCW 
- ETQW 
- COD 
- COD2 
- Q3 
- Q4 
- SOF2 

Update cycles are scheduled as they were a few months ago. Any problems? Check with PsP first! And let's not forget this important note! 
Regarding MBI banlist updates, read this thread first. 

More news on other new features later! Happy holidays!
