We're currently looking for gameserver admins willing to help us doing some tests with the pbucon feature. 

Do you have a public punkbuster enabled ET, COD2, Q4 (or COD, Q3, RTCW, SOF2) server, running ANY mod? Are you willing to add a YAWn profile to your pbucon server configuration? Please contact us by sending an email to info at yawn dot be with your server details (ip/port).
