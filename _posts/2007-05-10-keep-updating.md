While we are probably all waiting impatiently for Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, developments for YAWn! are never finished. You can expect regular updates the next few weeks, on both serverside and clientside. So keep an eye open on this newspage, because there might be a new version available soon! 

In the mean time, feel free to report bugs/leaks or other gossip using regular channels. Also people that are willing to help out with advice/developments/you name it, contact us!
