An unscheduled database upgrade made yawn.be unavailable this last weekend. But now we are back in town! Feel free to let us know if any issues occur. 
On development side of things, we are using Quake 4 as a 'template' game for a more generic version of YAWn!. This way we can hopefully support ET:Quake Wars and other games you might have on your wishlist. Still, much work to do! 

- Update: search using playernames is working again.
