Bit by bit we are tweaking the website and YAWn! services backend to get better performance. In case you might notice something that does not look right, please do tell us on the forum. 

Apart from that, what other (new or old) games you want YAWn! to support? Maybe we can add them to the list easily. Obviously other feedback is always appreciated.
