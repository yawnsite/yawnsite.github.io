Yesterday a quickfix for version 1.0.7 was released. The previous released 1.0.7 version reported to the server as being 1.0.6. Downloadable version now is 1.0.7.41607. 

On a side note and for your interest; reports and activitylogs can be accessed using the More ... hyperlink in the activity section on your right. It shows general as well as game specific activity. 

Last but not least, a tip for the enemy territory users. 
To see who's (yawn-)registered on the server, you can use the following bind:

```
/bind k echo [skipnotify]/yawn both 
```

To switch back to the etproguidonly mode, use this bind: 
```
/bind j echo [skipnotify]/yawn etproguidonly 
```

For games other than ET these extra arguments are useless. The "feature" is available in all versions, but was never documented. So here you go.
