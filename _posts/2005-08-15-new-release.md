Several fixes are implemented. You are adviced to download and install the new version. More information on how "upgrading" and installing is included in the readme.txt. 

- Server ip addresses are now DNS resolved before submitted 
- Alias tracking functionality (punkbuster) no longer screws up yawn 
- Tried to fix yawn not responding after quiting game and starting a new instance (including a memory leak :p) 
- cg_drawnotifytext 1 no longer needed 
- Fix for missing mod_url in server infostring for RTCW (1.33) Shrub 
- REQ: Add option to startup with windows (installer) 

Edit: 
Just added a quick fix, be sure you have build 1.0.6.38827 (or higher). You can check your version in the about dialog. Download again if needed :).
