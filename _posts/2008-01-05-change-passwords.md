Unfortunately due to recent events and issues, we urgently advise all YAWn! users to change their passwords. Please do not re-use passwords from other websites (or communities)! If your old password was the same for other websites (or communities), change them all, but do keep them different. 

To change your YAWn! password, you can use the Forgot Password function, or just login and change the password in the profile section. 

Thanks for your understanding.
