I guess some of you might be awaiting Quake 4. Well, Evenbalance announced Q4 to be Punkbuster enabled from day one. 

> Activision has contracted with Even Balance, Inc. to integrate PunkBuster Anti-Cheat software into the highly anticipated multiplayer component of QUAKE 4, currently being developed by Raven Software and executive produced by id Software. PunkBuster Anti-Cheat features will be available "out-of-the-box" with the retail release of the game.

As I already was messing around with Doom 3 a while back, it should be possible to make Quake 4 more or less YAWn friendly (I hope :p). 
The only thing I wonder is: would it be worth the trouble? Are you people waiting for a Q4/D3 enabled YAWn?
