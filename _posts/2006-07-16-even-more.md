For `Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory` users: it might be worth knowing a player search can now also be done using the 8 last characters of an etproguid, where before you needed the full 40 characters. 
Might be handy for `clanbase lookups. Of course you know this can return different players with different (full) etproguids: example.
