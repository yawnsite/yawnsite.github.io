I'm pleased to welcome `eclipse` in our team. He's our new partner in crime :). Eclipse is quite familiar with a small part of the Q3 community (ohoh!) and is willing to do some linux programming for YAWn!. 

So what can you expect in the near future (still in development)? Right... YAWn! for Linux. 

And... we even think of invading the Q3 guid domain :). Wish us luck!
