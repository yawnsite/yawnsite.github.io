Last week we got busy and implemented some (minor) changes: 

1- System to synchronize (other) game communities with punkbuster guids in our YAWn! database. As you might have read, crossfire.nu stepped forward and provides us regularly with a great deal of Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory guids. Thanks taLa, rafiki & co. 
The new information is visible, using the new icon , on the server details page and on the player search form. We might consider to implement this as well in the next release of the YAWn! Client. 

Does your game-community register punkbuster guids for any game we support? Don't hesitate to contact us and get synced! :) 

2- Activity details (for both services and YAWn! client actions) can now be accessed on the website. 

On a side note, the ongoing YUCON developments are still on track. More later!
