Just to show you people a little something to make YAWn! a little more attractive. Since most people not even know YAWn! as a client to run next to RtCW, I give you YAWn! stats. 
This gives you stats for each YAWn! user. Be aware this is just a basic test. I actually need your input on this to see what stats might be interesting. How should they be displayed (on this site), etc... Anyway, still lots of work to be done. 

*To avoid confusion: This is not in the downloadable version YET. I just want some opinions about it before releasing it to the public*
