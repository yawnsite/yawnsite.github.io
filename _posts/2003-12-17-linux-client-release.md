Yep, here it is! `Eclipse` finished the Linux client for RtCW. After this hard labour and intensive testing, everybody can start the New Year by installing Linux and trying this baby. 

The downloads are available in the download section. 
For problems, bugs and feedback go to our forum, or just contact Eclipse personally :).
