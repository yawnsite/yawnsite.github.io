Today the YAWn! warning list has been synchronized with punksbusted.com's public banlist. This is nothing new, except for Enemy Territory. For all other games this list was already more or less in sync. 

/edit: As of tonight we are in sync with pbbans.com's public banlists (for our supported games). 

How is this displayed? 
The players have the proper icons next to their name. Clicking the warning icon will show you the warnings for the specific player. 
Another new feature added to the grids is the YAWn! icon, it'll show you which players are registered YAWn! users.
