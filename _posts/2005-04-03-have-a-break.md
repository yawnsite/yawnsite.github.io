... unless someone out there lends a hand! 
One of these days/weeks our hostmachine will be shut down. This means no more YAWn website, no more new guids. 
So if someone out there has lots of bandwidth, diskspace, cpu and memory to spare, please do let us know. 
This might all be temporarily, it all depends on how fast we'll find a new home!
