We started to consider a YAWn! version for other games a while ago. But to do this properly I think it's best to do a complete rewrite and start from scratch again. The Windows clients will be .NET, serverside will still be J2EE webservices. 

Games in mind:
* Return to Castle Wolfenstein 
* Enemy Territory (combination with etpro /cheaters command?) 
* Call of Duty (Punkbuster soon to be released I think?) 
* Quake 3 
* Soldier of Fortune (If interested?) 

For now these are only draft plans, but I just wanted to post something here :). Please feel free to give feedback or comments. 
I have no contact with the COD or SOF community what so ever, so especially feedback from their side will be appreciated :). Just spread the word :p
