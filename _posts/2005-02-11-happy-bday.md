just noticed that in February 2003 we officially started YAWn!. Yes, yes, that makes the YAWn! project 2 years old! Time flies! 
Quote dating back to one and a half month after official release (March 2003): 

> Well, well, we're still up and running here! At the moment we have more than 5200 unique guids and more than 8000 nicks in our database. 
> Let's go for that 10000! C'mon! 
> Yeh :) 

Anyway, coming up the next few days: 
- User registration 
- Add your own server to Online Yawn (for registered users only) 
- Make your server yawnable for the public (on request) 
- Detailed statistics per day 

Still in development, but making progress each day: YAWn.NET Client for ET/RtCW/COD. 

I noticed a lot of "yawn-alike" applications out there these days, so if you think you can help us in any way, feel free to contact us.
