Tomorrow, December 5th, we are planning to do some maintenance release on the server. Please expect some downtime from 7PM to 11PM CET. 

What's going to change? 
- major changes to the Online YAWn feature 
- Auto-YAWn scheduler improvements 
- better visibility on YAWn activities 
- changes to the database to improve reporting/history logs 
- preparing for pbucon YAWn profiles (YUCON) 

Speaking of which, now more than ever, we are looking for (public) game server admins, willing to create a pb ucon profile to test some new YAWn features. Please contact us by sending an email to info at yawn dot be with your server details (ip/port).
