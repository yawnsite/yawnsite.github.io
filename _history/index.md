      <p>With Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory being released, plans for a code re-write are made, supporting multiple games. The main focus is on Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, while dreaming of a YAWn! client compatible with Quake 3, Call of Duty and Soldier of Fortune.</p>

      <p>Game specific patches more often than not disrupted YAWn! client to work correctly. Therefore we played with the idea to limit usage of game specific client console, and instead make use of other means. This would give the benefit of supporting even more Punkbuster enabled games.
      Although development started and future looked bright, the original plan to release this as version 2.0 was never executed.</p>

      <h1>Link to (other) game communities</h1>
      <p>A system to synchronize other game communities with punkbuster guids in our YAWn! database was invented. Crossfire.nu provides us regularly with a great deal of Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory guids and a link to their user profile.
      The links were visible on the YAWn! website and in the YAWn! client software. Unfortunately talks with the former clanbase.com community lead to nowhere. No other communities stepped forward.
